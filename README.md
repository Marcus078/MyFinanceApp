BANK MOBILE APPLICATION

We have developed a bank mobile app with the following features: check balance, transfer, withdraw, deposit, and transaction history.

User Registration: 
New users must first register by providing their name, surname, email, username, cellphone number, and password. The application will store these details and generate an account number for the user.

Login: 
Registered users can log in using the email and password they provided during registration. Upon login, the application directs them to the main menu, which displays their name, surname, and account number.

Main Menu: 
The main menu offers various options, including balance check, transfer, withdraw, deposit, and transaction history.

Transfer Feature: 
When selecting the transfer option, users can only transfer funds to other registered users within the system. They will need to provide the recipient's account number and the amount to be transferred. After confirming the transfer, the sender's balance will be updated accordingly.
